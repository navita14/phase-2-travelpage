        "funfact":"The Hen na Hotel in Tokyo Ginza is the world’s first and only hotel run by a robot. Ideal for antisocial travellers who prefer to avoid human contact at the end of a long day of sightseeing, multi-lingual robots staff the hotel. They can turn their heads, blink and carry luggage. “Henn” means “to change,” which represents the hotel’s commitment “for evolution in striving for the extraordinary sensation and comfort that lies beyond the ordinary.” There is also keyless locking and entry through facial recognition and free WiFI. Tokyo is also home to a robot restaurant. In Shinjuku, you can visit the Robot Restaurant to see robot monsters, dancers and lasers perform as you snack on bento boxes."

Well, for anyone who knows that Colombia historically is famous for its gold reserves, this may not be quite as surprising as for others. Bogota’s famed Museo de Oro (Gold Museum) houses 55,000 pieces of gold. Most are historic artifacts from the pre-Colombian indigenous tribes. They include all sorts of jewelry, body ornamentation, artistic objects, sacrificial objects, tools and other gold pieces."
