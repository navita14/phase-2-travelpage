Ideal for antisocial travellers who prefer to avoid human contact at the end of a long day of sightseeing, multi-lingual robots staff the hotel. They can turn their heads, blink and carry luggage. “Henn” means “to change,” which represents the hotel’s commitment “for evolution in striving for the extraordinary sensation and comfort that lies beyond the ordinary.” There is also keyless locking and entry through facial recognition and free WiFI. Tokyo is also home to a robot restaurant. In Shinjuku, you can visit the Robot Restaurant to see robot monsters, dancers and lasers perform as you snack on bento boxes.",
